# Twelescreen

Work in progress.

Originally based on this example, and gradually moving away from that:

Install NPM.

Run the server with `npm app.js`.

### Bower

To manage front-end components install bower with `npm install -g bower`

Then do something like this to install new ones: `bower install socket.io-client`.

Add the `--save` flag to add them to `component.json`: `bower install socket.io-client --save`.

Install all components needed (as specified in `component.json`) with `bower install`.
